    <p>
        With this form you can create a new continuous transfer job to transfer studies from a source server to a destination
        continuously from a study start date until an optional end date. If no end date is specified the transfer will run
        until it is stopped manually.
        Continuous transfer jobs are put into a queue and will be processed by a worker when the time is right.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each continuous transfer job contains several transfer tasks that define what data to transfer. In the transfer
        job you can specify the query of what to transfer, like for example Patient ID, Modalities or Study Description.

        <br />
        If PatientID or AccessionNumber contains leading zeros those are relevant as it is not a number but a text
        identifier. So make sure that your Excel file does not remove those leading zeros by setting the column type to text or
        add a single quote ' as prefix to the text cell itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following columns must be defined in the batch file:
        <dl>
            <dt>PatientID</dt>
            <dd>
                The unique ID of the patient in the PACS. This column is required.
            </dd>
            <dt>StudyInstanceUID</dt>
            <dd>
                A unique ID that identifies the study. This column is required.
            </dd>
            <dt>SeriesInstanceUID</dt>
            <dd>
                An unique ID that identifies the series. This column is optional to only transfer
                specific series of a study.
            </dd>
            <dt>Pseudonym</dt>
            <dd>
                A pseudonym to pseudonymize the images during transfer. This field is required
                if you don't have the permission to transfer unpseudonymized (the default).
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </p>
    <p>
        The "SeriesInstanceUID" is optional. If provided, only the specified series of the study will be transferred. The
        provided pseudonym is optional if you have the permissions to transfer unpseudonymized. It will be set as PatientID
        and PatientName. So it is recommended to use cryptic identifier strings (e.g. "XFE3TEW2N").
