<p>
    With a Batch Query you can create a job to find the data of multiple studies in a source DICOM / PACS server. Batch
    query jobs are put into a queue and will be processed by a worker when the time is right. You will get an Email when
    the job is finished (or failed for some reason).
</p>
<p>
    Each batch query job contains several query tasks that define what studies to search for. The search terms must be
    specified in a CSV file with <strong>semicolons <mark>;</mark> as separators</strong>. If your data is in an Excel
    file then it must be exported to a CSV file (by using the Excel built-in exporter). The first row of the CSV file
    must contain the header with the column titles (see below). Each following row represents a query task.
</p>
<p>
    <strong class="text-danger">Cave!</strong><br />
    If PatientID or AccessionNumber contains leading zeros those are relevant as it is not a number but a text
    identifer. So make sure after loading or saving a CSV file with Excel those values are correct. It's alway a good
    idea to view the CSV file with a text editor and check if the format is correct. If not then you must use another
    CSV editor or force the Excel data importer to skip the automatic type conversion (see <a
        href="https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/stop-excel-convert-text-to-number-date-format-csv-file/">Stop Excel
        from Converting Text to Number</a>).
</p>
<p>
    These are the columns in the batch file to execute your queries:
    <dl>
        <dt>TaskID</dt>
        <dd>A consecutive unique number that identifies the query task.</dd>
        <dt>PatientID</dt>
        <dd>The unique ID of the patient in the PACS.</dd>
        <dt>PatientName</dt>
        <dd>The name of the patient.</dd>
        <dt>PatientBirthDate</dt>
        <dd>The birth date of the patient.</dd>
        <dt>AccessionNumber</dt>
        <dd>The Accession Number (a unique ID) of the study.</dd>
        <dt>From</dt>
        <dd>Only include studies newer than or equal to this date.</dd>
        <dt>Until</dt>
        <dd>Only include studies older than or equal to this date.</dd>
        <dt>Modality</dt>
        <dd>The modality of the study.</dd>
    </dl>
</p>
<p>
    TaskID is always required. The patient must be identifiable by either "PatientID" or "PatientName" together with
    "PatientBirthDate". The remaining fields are optional and may limit the results for what you really need.
</p>
<p>
    Make sure that your CSV file encoding is correct by opening it with a normal text editor (ideally under Windows).
    Especially look that umlauts (äöü) are correct. If something is wrong then try to export your CSV file from Excel
    with UTF-8 encondig.
</p>
<p>
    The result of the batch query can viewed and downloaded from ADIT. The downloaded CSV file contains more data then
    what can be viewed on the website. Each result contains the "PatientID" and "StudyInstanceUID" which is necessary
    for a batch tranfer job. So a batch query job is in most cases the preperation step for a batch transfer.
